<h2>Planes Are Big.</h2>
<p>It’s hard to tell from looking at the pictures in your textbook, but planes are not nearly as small as the little ones on your page! Even the biggest pictures in your textbook don’t get close - planes are at least 2-3 times larger than that.</p>
<p>A little experiment: Hold your arms wide out. Make them even wider. Now curl your hands upwards and scream. That might be how big a plane is.</p>
</br>

<h2> You Can Go In The Plane If You Try Hard Enough.</h2>
<p>They won’t be happy about it!</p>
</br>

<h2></h2>
<h2>The Lights Look Really Good Right About Now - But Don’t Look Directly At Them.</h2>
<p>Yes, the lights are delicious and you want them in your eyes - who wouldn’t. But you can’t look right at them. It’s just how things work right now and we’re just going to have to do something else.</p>
</br>

<h2></h2>
<h2>You Will Meet Santana.</h2>
<p>When you least expect it, you’ll be backing up a big ol’ plane and you’ll hear a calming voice from behind say “that’s a big ol’ plane you’re backing up there”. It will be nobody other than 10-time Grammy award winning guitarist Carlos Santana! Immediately report him to security, he is a threat.</p>
</br>

<h2></h2>
<h2>When Planes Take Off, They Land Somewhere Else Later.</h2>
<p>Most people think when we wave our lights at planes, we’re directing them and their passengers to the inescapable prison known as the sky. But really, all planes eventually plummet into the Grand Canyon killing every single person on board, to the constant dismay of the guy whose job it is to clean that all up. Messy!</p>
</br>

<h2>You Can Use Corn Cobs Instead Of Lights.</h2>
<p>That’s right! All those days training to hold onto the lights for inhuman periods of time? Could have been holding onto corn cobs instead!</p>
</br>

<h2></h2>
<h2>Don’t Eat The Corn Cobs Though.</h2>
<p>Big Mistake. Everyone’s going to want some, and you only brought two cobs. Look who is the fool now (You are the corn cob fool).</p>
</br>

<h2></h2>
<h2>You Can Only Lead The Planes So Far From The Runway Before They Catch You.</h2>
Every schoolboy’s dream is to lead the planes back to your house so you can tell them incredible lies, and your professors might have even let you do that during training. However, in the real world there’s no funny business allowed. Unless your house is right next to the airport, you’re going to have to settle for telling the planes your awful falsehoods in the hangars.
<h2></h2>
</br>

<h2>Just Do Your Best!</h2>
<p>In training when they said to do the worst job you possibly could, don’t do that. Common mistake!</p>
</br>

<h2></h2>
<h2>Don’t Forget Your Purpose.</h2>
<p>To crash as many of those suckers into each other as possible!</p>
